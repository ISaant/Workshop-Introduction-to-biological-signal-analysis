# Workshop:Introduction to biological signal analysis 

## Welcome!!
In this repositories you will find 3 files and 2 C folders containing examples of the topics seen in the workshop. 

## Files: 
### Nyquist Theorem.ipynb
Part One: Instrumentation and Sampling Theory

### Feature Extraction.ipynb
Part Two: Extraction of spectral features

### Classification Algorithms.ipynb
Part Three: Pattern Recognition 


## Folders:
### Img:
It only contain supporting images for the examples 

### Signals:
As its name implies, it contains biological signals, specifically ECG and PCG, sampled at 4069Hz. Records begin with an "n" for normal recordings and "r" for pathology records, and end with an "E" or "P" to differentiate between ECG and PCG recordings.
